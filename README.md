# Concrete-Crack-Image-Detection

# 🧱 Surface Crack Detection – Deep Learning Project (CNN)
## 📌 Overview
- This project focuses on automated detection of concrete surface cracks using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a high-quality dataset of concrete images from Kaggle and achieves 97.56% test accuracy.
- This system can assist engineers, inspectors, and construction teams in detecting cracks early — improving safety, reducing maintenance costs, and enabling real-time monitoring.

🎯 Problem Statement
Concrete structures naturally degrade over time. Manual inspection is:
* Time-consuming
* Error-prone
* Expensive
* Not scalable for large infrastructure
The goal of this project is to:
* Build a CNN model that can automatically classify images as Crack or Non-Crack
* Achieve high accuracy suitable for real-world use
* Provide a reusable pipeline for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction
* Enable future deployment in mobile apps, IoT devices, or inspection robots
